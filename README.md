# MINI-PROJECT-BANKING-SYSTEM-
This is a code of banking system which tells us how it actually works.

##Theory:
- This code is to know about the working of banking system with vectors and many other operators.
- we can create an accout.
- we can edit the account details.
- we can add or withdraw the money.
- we can check the details of the account if previously created.

### WORKING AND OUTCOMES:
- In this code we have taken the use of vectors as it is used for a very large scale of entries.
- Where else in arrays we should declare the number of elements or entries.
- This code is an example of how does the banking system works.
- This will create as many accounts needed and saves the details of each and every account.
- This is an very helpful code which explains the banking system.
